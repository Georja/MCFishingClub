        <p>Marsden Cove Fishing Club is located at the Marsden Cove Marina (next to Land and Sea Café) and overlooks the marina with prime viewing of the boat ramp — which can provide some entertainment on the odd occasion.<br> <br> Members, both local and from further afield have created a strong sense of community within the club. It’s a great place to bring the family, meet up with your friends, tell those great fishing stories, and compete for the annual angler of year prize. <br> <br> To become a member, pop into the club on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night and fill out a membership form, or complete the online registration form.</p>
